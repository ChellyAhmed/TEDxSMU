# Website for TEDxSouthMediterraneanUniversity

Developed with love by Ahmed Chelly (inspired from some random template from the internet that I heavily customized) in 2022, and reused by other cool people in 2024 (hopefully).

Made sure it was responsive and accessible to everyone, and that it was easy to use and navigate.

Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, no frameworks or libraries used. I assumed that a time would come and I would have to hand it over to someone else, so I made sure the tech stack was beginner-friendly.

I followed the guidelines of TED and TEDx for a website design. I think you only need to fill in the content and you're good to go.

If you need any help, feel free to contact me.

PS: Feel free to commit and push your changes, but please make sure to keep the attribution to the original "random template from the internet". You can also fork or clone, but I would appreciate if you directly commit to this repo. It took me some time to design it and I will be very happy to see my code growing and extended by others. You know I'm an open source enthusiast. Thanks!

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.
